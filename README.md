# To start the project
- install dependencies for node.js - `npm install`
- to run the server - `npm run start`. If Mongodb is not started - `mongod`
- to run the AngularJS - `npm run serve`
# A bit of summary
- Тhe structure of the API is based on what was shown during the academy.
- From what I found as online resources and the time I had, I did what I could with AngularJS.
